# Original Idea

We began spit-balling ideas and decided to wire-frame our vision. We wanted an application where the user could put in some specifics and then get activity options. We dreamed big at first, but with time constraints we still landed among the stars. Finding the two APIs we wanted to use, helped narrow down our big picture. That’s how Snack n’ Dash was born! Checkout our first wire-frame below.

# Future Development 

The future is bright for Snack n’ Dash. We want to continue to provide our users with fast and easy trail/snack ideas for their outdoor adventures. A goal for future features is to allow the user to add even more specifications to their search:
 - Trail difficulty & length
 - Diet choices including max calories, high protein, low carb, etc. 
 
 Come back in a few to see how Snack n’ Dash has grown.
